**Project Briefing**

The HASTA Travel UTM system is being developed to solve problems caused by old, manual systems that slow down the company's operations. Many organizations face similar issues, especially those that rely on everyday tasks to run smoothly. This project will replace these outdated methods with a faster, automated system to help HASTA manage its operations better, reduce mistakes, and make important information easier to access.

To understand the current challenges and needs of HASTA, we used surveys and gathered feedback from everyone involved in the company's operations. By taking everyoneâ€™s thoughts and experiences into account, we were able to identify key pain points and understand how the system could be improved. Based on this input, we have developed a solution that aims to streamline processes and enhance performance.

By introducing this system, we aim to make the company more efficient by removing time-consuming processes and making everything work faster. The new system will not only improve daily operations but also help the company make better decisions with up-to-date and accurate information. It will improve communication, simplify vehicle management, and speed up bookings, resulting in a better experience for both customers and employees.

In the long run, this system will help HASTA grow digitally and stay ahead in a changing market by improving efficiency and ensuring the company can adapt to future needs.
